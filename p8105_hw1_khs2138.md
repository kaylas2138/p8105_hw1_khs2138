# Problem 1

## Load and Explore Dataset

``` r
library(moderndive)
data("early_january_weather")
jan_df = early_january_weather
```

Below are some basic descriptors of this dataset, which provides hourly
weather for airports:

- The data set has **358 rows** and **15 variables**.
- The variables in this dataset are as follows: *origin, year, month,
  day, hour, temp, dewp, humid, wind_dir, wind_speed, wind_gust, precip,
  pressure, visib, time_hour*.
- Of particular note, the *origin* of the weather is *EWR* and the data
  is recorded for the *year* *2013*. It covers data on the *month* of
  *1* (January) up to the *15* th *day*, hence “early” January weather!
- The **mean temperature** is 39.5821229

## Data Visualization

Creating a scatter plot of `temp` (y) vs `time_hour` (x); color points
using the `humid` variable (adding `color = ...` inside of `aes` in your
ggplot code should help). Describe patterns that are apparent in this
plot.

``` r
library(tidyverse)
ggplot(jan_df, aes(x = hour, y = temp, color = humid)) + geom_point()
```
