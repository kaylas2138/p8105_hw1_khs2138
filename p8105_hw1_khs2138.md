# Problem 1

## Load and Explore Dataset

Loading package moderndive, creating a dataframe from the
early_january_weather dataset within that package.

``` r
library(moderndive)
data("early_january_weather")
jan_df = early_january_weather
```

Below are some basic descriptors of this dataset, which provides hourly
weather for airports (using in line code):

- The data set has **358 rows** and **15 variables**.
- The variables in this dataset are as follows: *origin, year, month,
  day, hour, temp, dewp, humid, wind_dir, wind_speed, wind_gust, precip,
  pressure, visib, time_hour*.
- Of particular note, the *origin* of the weather is *EWR* and the data
  is recorded for the *year* *2013*. It covers data on the *month* of
  *1* (January) up to the *15* th *day*, hence “early” January weather!
- The **mean temperature** is 39.5821229

## Data Visualization

Creating a scatter plot of `temp` (y) vs `time_hour` (x); color points
using the `humid` variable (adding `color = ...` inside of `aes` in your
ggplot code should help). Describe patterns that are apparent in this
plot.

``` r
library(tidyverse)
ggplot(jan_df, aes(x = hour, y = temp, color = humid)) + geom_point()
```

``` r
ggsave("hour_temp.pdf", height = 4, width = 8)
```

# Problem 2

## Create Dataframe

Creating a dataframe with comprised of: a random sample from a normal
distribution, a logical vector indicating which elements from the random
sample are greater than 0, a character vector, and a factor vector with
three levels. All of lenght 10.

``` r
types_df = tibble(
  vec_norm = rnorm(10, mean = 0, sd = 1),
  vec_log = vec_norm > 0,
  vec_char = c(letters[0:10]),
  vec_factor = factor(c(0,1,0,0,1,2,2,1,2,0))
)
```

## Means of data

Exploring means of the variables in the above dataframe:

``` r
library(tidyverse)
mean(pull(types_df, var = vec_norm))
```

    ## [1] 0.1311719

``` r
mean(pull(types_df, var = vec_log))
```

    ## [1] 0.5

``` r
mean(pull(types_df, var = vec_char))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(types_df, var = vec_char)): argument is not
    ## numeric or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(types_df, var = vec_factor))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(types_df, var = vec_factor)): argument is not
    ## numeric or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

- As expected, the mean of `vec_norm`, which is numeric works and is
  0.1311719
- The logical vector, `vec_log` seems to return the proportion of TRUE
  entries in the logical vector. In this case, 5 / 10 = 0.5
- Both the means of the character vector and the factor vector return NA
  and a warning that the arguments (the vectors passed) are not
  numerical or logical.

## Exploring Coercion

``` r
as.numeric(pull(types_df, var = vec_log))
as.numeric(pull(types_df, var = vec_char))
```

    ## Warning: NAs introduced by coercion

``` r
as.numeric(pull(types_df, var = vec_factor))
```

Coercion to numeric works for the **logical factor** (converting
TRUE/FALSE to 1/0) and for the **factor vector** (converts them to
respective levels). It fails for the **character vector**, returning an
“NAs introduced by coercion”.

**Relation to results of calling mean on these variables:** I presume
this means that when calling the mean() function, it will calcualte
numeric values directly, and it automatically coerces logical values to
numerics to calculate the proportion of TRUE/FALSE. But mean() will not
coerce factor vectors to numeric.
